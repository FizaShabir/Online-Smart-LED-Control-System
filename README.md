## Introduction
The **Online Smart LED Control System** enables remote management of LED lights, allowing users to control brightness, color, and scheduling through a mobile app or web application. This project aims to enhance convenience, energy efficiency, and smart home automation.

## Problem Statement
Traditional lighting systems are limited and energy inefficient, leading to a growing demand for customizable, remotely controllable options in smart homes. This project seeks to fill these gaps by creating an online-controlled LED system that enhances user experience and promotes energy savings.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a smart LED system that can be controlled remotely via an online interface (web app or mobile app).
- Provide features for controlling LED brightness, color, and scheduling.
- Integrate energy-saving features, such as automatic dimming based on room activity or time of day.
- Include a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the system.
- Provide real-time monitoring of energy consumption and potential savings.

## Methodology
1. Research and select components suitable for smart LED control.
2. Develop hardware using a microcontroller for LED operation.
3. Implement a mobile or web application for remote management.
4. Integrate and test the system for functionality and efficiency.
5. Deploy the system and collect real-world feedback for improvements.

## Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional prototype of an **Online Smart LED Control System**.
- A user-friendly mobile or web application for managing LED lights remotely.

## Resources Required
### Hardware
- LEDs
